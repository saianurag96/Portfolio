<h3>Research</h3>

[__Image Colorization using Deep Learning: Literature Review__](https://github.com/saianurag96/Research/blob/main/Image%20Colorization/Image%20Colorization%20using%20Deep%20Learning%20-%20Literature%20Review.pdf)
##### Abstract:
Image colorization is an image-to-image translation problem. It can be considered a pixel-wise regression problem where structures in inputs and outputs are highly aligned. Automatic colorization is an active area of research because of its wide variety of applications. There are several techniques to solve the problem, and the colorization networks used are classified into several categories. This paper aims at studying the state-of-the-art algorithms implemented for the image colorization problem. The work reviews and summarizes three deep learning models with plain network architecture. The inputs to these networks are natural images, and the output is a single image. The primary focus of the papers is on automatic colorization without human intervention.


[__Image Colorization Enhancement using Transfer Learning__](https://github.com/saianurag96/Research/blob/main/Image%20Colorization/Image%20Colorization%20Enhancement%20using%20Transfer%20Learning.pdf)

##### Abstract:
Image colorization is an active area of research, and many new strategies are introduced every day wherein deep learning is extensively used to enhance the process. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning method that uses EfficientNet as a feature extractor to aid the process of fully automatic image colorization. Later, the results of the suggested method have been compared with few existing techniques which aim to solve the same problem.

[__5G Millimeter Wave â€“ Beamforming Challenges and Techniques__](https://github.com/saianurag96/Research/blob/main/5G%20Network/5G%20Millimeter%20Wave%20%E2%80%93%20Beamforming%20Challenges%20and%20Techniques.pdf)

##### Abstract:

The 5G network is planned to serve a high quantity of mobile data traffic and a significant number of wireless connections while improving communication delay, reliability, and security. Applications such as autonomous cars, remote surgery, augmented/virtual reality games demand an increase in data rates. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) is one of the critical innovations to get a better data rate in 5G communications. It is the under-utilized spectrum and is now used for 5G networks and beyond. But there are challenges with mmWaves as they are prone to high path loss, susceptible to blockages, and fading. Several cellular networks, base stations are required at very short distances to maintain the communication. There are several techniques proposed to mitigate the challenges. As we advance, Massive MIMO combined with beamforming will play a key role in 5G communication and is now a primary research area. Using beamforming, wireless signals can focus on a targeted device instead of spreading from a broadcast antenna in all directions. This will result in a stable, faster, and reliable connection. Fine beam alignment between user and antenna is very crucial for initial access and needs to be maintained owing to the channel fading and user mobility. This paper reviews classification of beamforming that includes analog, digital, and hybrid in detail and their applications in real-time. Also, this paper aims to study various beamforming methods, analyze challenges and identify the best-suited techniques that can be employed in massive MIMO frameworks.


__["Maximum power point tracking for PV panels using ant colony optimization"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8245004) Published in IEEE__

##### Abstract:
Output power of solar panel varies with respect to irradiance and temperature. So maximum power should be extracted from solar panels using Maximum Power Point Tracking. As irradiance changes continuously during the day, many algorithms fail to give maximum power as they get stuck at local maximum. In order to overcome this problem, we propose Ant Colony Optimization which obtains global maximum and improves the efficiency of solar panels. The proposed work has been implemented using Matlab/Simulink. Also, the hardware results obtained indicate the superiority of Ant Colony Optimization over the conventional Maximum Power Point Tracking methods.
